    "\r\n",
    "### Understanding recursive functions:\r\n",
    "- Recursive functions are functions that call themselves within their definition.\r\n",
    "- They break down a problem into smaller, similar subproblems and solve each subproblem recursively until a base case is reached.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Recursive vs. iterative solutions:\r\n",
    "- Recursive solutions use function calls to solve problems, while iterative solutions use loops.\r\n",
    "- Recursive solutions can be elegant but may consume more memory due to function call overhead.\r\n",
    "- Iterative solutions are often more efficient in terms of memory usage and execution time.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Recursive thinking and problem-solving:\r\n",
    "- Recursive thinking involves recognizing problems that can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem.\r\n",
    "- It requires understanding base cases and how to combine results from smaller instances to solve larger instances.\r\n",

    "## Lambda Functions\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### What are lambda functions?\r\n",
    "- Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are small, inline functions defined using the `lambda` keyword.\r\n",
    "- They are used for short, simple operations where defining a separate function would be unnecessary.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Syntax of lambda functions:\r\n",
    "- The syntax of a lambda function is `lambda arguments: expression`.\r\n",
    "- They can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Use cases for lambda functions:\r\n",
    "- Lambda functions are commonly used in situations where a simple function is needed for a short period and defining a full function seems unnecessary.\r\n",
    "- They are often used with higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "### Functions as first-class citizens:\r\n",
    "- In Python, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be treated like any other variable.\r\n",
    "- They can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Passing functions as arguments:\r\n",
    "- Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, allowing for dynamic behavior\r\n",
