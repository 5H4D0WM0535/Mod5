    "# Python `if` Statement\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "An `if` statement in Python is used to conditionally execute a block of code based on the evaluation of a boolean expression. Hereâ€™s a detailed description of its key features, characteristics, and functionalities:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 1. Basic Syntax\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The basic syntax of an `if` statement in Python is as follows:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<code>\r\n",
    "if condition:\r\n",
    "    # Code block to be executed if the condition is true\r\n",
    "</code>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Example\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<code>\r\n",
    "x = 10\r\n",
    "if x > 5:\r\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\r\n",
    "</code>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 2. `if`-`else` Statement\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "An `if`-`else` statement allows you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether the condition is true or false.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<code>\r\n",
    "x = 10\r\n",
    "if x > 5:\r\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\r\n",
    "else:\r\n",
    "    print(\"x is not greater than 5\")\r\n",
    "</code>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 3. `if`-`elif`-`else` Statement\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "An `if`-`elif`-`else` statement allows you to check multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on which condition is true.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<code>\r\n",
    "x = 10\r\n",
    "if x > 10:\r\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 10\")\r\n",
    "elif x < 10:\r\n",
    "    print(\"x is less than 10\")\r\n",
    "else:\r\n",
    "    print(\"x is equal to 10\")\r\n",
    "</code>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 4. Nested `if` Statements\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You can nest `if` statements within other `if`, `elif`, or `else` blocks to handle more complex conditional logic.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<code>\r\n",
    "x = 10\r\n",
    "if x > 5:\r\n",
    "    if x < 15:\r\n",
    "        print(\"x is between 5 and 15\")\r\n",
    "    else:\r\n",
    "        print(\"x is greater than or equal to 15\")\r\n",
    "</code>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 5. Using Logical Operators\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Python provides logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to combine multiple conditions in an `if` statement.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<code>\r\n",
    "x = 10\r\n",
    "y = 5\r\n",
    "if x > 5 and y > 5:\r\n",
    "    print(\"Both x and y are greater than 5\")\r\n",
    "</code>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 6. Using Comparison Operators\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You can use comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) to compare values in `if` statements.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<code>\r\n",
    "x = 10\r\n",
    "if x == 10:\r\n",
    "    print(\"x is equal to 10\")\r\n",
    "</code>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 7. Using Membership Operators\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Python provides membership operators (`in`, `not in`) to test for membership in sequences like lists, tuples, and strings.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<code>\r\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\r\n",
    "if \"banana\" in fruits:\r\n",
    "    print(\"Banana is in the list of fruits\")\r\n",
    "</code>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 8. Using Identity Operators\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Python provides identity operators (`is`, `is not`) to compare the memory locations of two objects.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<code>\r\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3]\r\n",
    "y = [1, 2, 3]\r\n",
    "if x is y:\r\n",
    "    print(\"x and y are the same object\")\r\n",
    "else:\r\n",
    "    print(\"x and y are different objects\")\r\n",
    "</code>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 9. Ternary `if` Expression\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A ternary `if` expression provides a concise way to write conditional expressions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<code>\r\n",
    "x = 10\r\n",
    "result = \"greater than 5\" if x > 5 else \"not greater than 5\"\r\n",
    "</code>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Summary\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Python `if` statements provide a powerful way to control the flow of your program based on conditions. They can be used to execute different blocks of code, handle multiple conditions, and perform complex logical operations. By combining `if` statements with logical, comparison, membership, and identity operators, you can create flexible and robust conditional logic in your Python programs.\r\n"
