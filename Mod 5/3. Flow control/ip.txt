# Network Report

This document details the configuration of various network devices and their respective IP addresses.

## Summary

Our network consists of multiple segments including routers, switches, access points, servers, workstations, and printers. Each device has been assigned a unique IP address for identification and management. Maintaining accurate records of these IP addresses is crucial for network management.

## Routers Configuration

Routers are essential for directing traffic across our network. The IP addresses for the routers are:
Router 1 is configured with IP address 172.16.0.1. This is the gateway for the main network segment. It handles most of the outbound traffic and provides a secure connection to the internet.

Router 2 uses IP address 10.0.0.2 to manage the second floor network. This router is equipped with advanced QoS settings to prioritize critical traffic.

Router 3 has IP address 192.168.10.3 and serves the guest network. It provides limited access to internal resources and isolates guest traffic from the main network.

In addition to the above, our routers support various protocols and are equipped with the latest firmware updates. The models used are all compliant with the latest industry standards. Regular firmware updates are scheduled to ensure they remain secure and efficient.

## Switches Setup

Switches facilitate the internal communication between different devices within the same network segment. The switches in our network have the following IP addresses:

Server Gamma: 10.0.2.13. It hosts various internal applications and services used by the staff.

Server Delta: 192.168.4.14. This server is used for backup and disaster recovery purposes. It stores redundant copies of critical data.

Our servers handle various tasks including file storage, application hosting, and database management. They are equipped with high-capacity storage and redundant power supplies to ensure reliability. Backup and disaster recovery plans are in place to protect data integrity.

## Workstations

Our employees use workstations that are assigned the following IP addresses:

Workstation 1: 192.168.5.15. This workstation is used by the network administrator for monitoring and managing the network.

Workstation 2: 172.16.3.16. Assigned to the finance department, this workstation handles all financial transactions and record-keeping.

Workstation 3: 10.0.3.17. Used by the HR department, this workstation manages employee records and recruitment processes.

Workstation 4: 192.168.6.18. This workstation is used for software development and testing purposes.

Workstation 5: 172.16.4.19. Assigned to the marketing department, this workstation handles all promotional and marketing activities.

Each workstation is configured with the necessary software and security measures to protect sensitive data and maintain productivity. Antivirus software is updated regularly to protect against threats.

## Printers

Network printers are essential for daily operations. They are assigned the following IP addresses:

Printer 1: 10.0.4.20. Located in the main office, this printer handles most of the high-volume printing tasks.

Printer 2: 192.168.7.21. This printer is located in the finance department and is used for printing financial reports.

Printer 3: 172.16.5.22. Located in the HR department, this printer is used for printing employee records and recruitment forms.

These printers support high-volume printing and are connected to the network for easy access by all employees. Regular maintenance is performed to ensure they operate smoothly.

## Miscellaneous Devices

Other devices in our network include various IoT devices and management consoles:

Device 1: 192.168.8.23. This device monitors the environmental conditions in the server room.

Device 2: 10.0.5.24. A network management console that provides real-time insights into network performance.

Device 3: 172.16.6.25. Used for controlling the building's access control system.

Device 4: 192.168.9.26. This device manages the building's HVAC system to ensure optimal temperature and air quality.

Device 5: 10.0.6.27. An IoT device that monitors and controls the lighting system in the building.
